Hello, and welcome to SarlinS very own webpage generated with Markdown-language for a school project!

## Information about me

I'm a 30-year old male from Finland, with a passion in learning and adapting to new situations. My hobbies include jogging, swimming, cycling and playing or watching video games on my computer. I have a previous Bachelor's Degree in Nursing, but now I'm studying to become a Software Developer in Oulu University of Applied Sciences. [Here](https://www.oamk.fi/fi/) is a link to their website, if you're interested!

I have a 9 month old dog at home, whose name is Siri.

My favourite emojis include 😂, 🤣, ❤️ and 💪. I think they describe me quite well as a person!

One of my favourite quotes is from the movie Forrest Gump:
> Life is like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're going to get.

### Thanks for reading this short introduction about me!
